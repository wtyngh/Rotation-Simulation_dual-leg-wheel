# Rotation-Simulation_dual-leg-wheel
Dual concentric leg-wheel simulation on uneven terrains

This document includes "main" and "entry and function" 


This code is used for observing the difference between leg and wheel, especially for the different characteristics on different terrains

Condiser geometry constrain and dynamic effect

Concentric dual model
Position control, input 'time-theta, time-r' trajectory

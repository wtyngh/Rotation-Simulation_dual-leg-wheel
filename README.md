# Rotation-Simulation_dual-leg-wheel
Dual concentric leg-wheel simulation on uneven terrains

This document includes "main" and "entry and function" 


% This code is used for observing the difference between leg and wheel
% Especially for the different characteristics on different terrains
%
% Geometry included
% Dynamic condisered
%
% Concentric dual model
% Position control, input 'time-theta, time-r' trajectory
